      Hi, I'm Demo!
      <ol>
        <li>I'm here because I want to go beyond Excel's static data and create live charts using APIs</li>
        <li>I've created Excel macros before and looked at survey data using SPSS</li>
        <li>I would like to learn about which chart type to use when</li>
      </ol>
